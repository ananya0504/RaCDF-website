She is a type of person who loves to interact with people, talk to them about likes, dislikes, or just life.
If an attempt to bring a smile to someone’s face (including herself) could be called a hobby? She’d have that as her's, though she loves to read and dance too. In a short line - just a book you would not want to finish too soon!

I am an introvert kind of person and used to hesitate a lot to reach out to people. Being in the club, initially, I had to but now I like to contact people, ask my doubts, solve their. I started my tenure this year and we have conducted a number of events all together, working and learning together.  I learnt to be a host and also to be a guest. And above all, I learnt to work for society and it's betterment.</p>
